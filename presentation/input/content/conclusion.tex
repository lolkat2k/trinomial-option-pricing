  \frametitle{Conclusion}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Validation should be achievable
  \item We have (almost) implemented a solution giving us the following insights:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item General understanding of option pricing
      \item CUDA programming and programming model
      \item Understanding of a non-trivial Futhark program
      \item Translation from Futhark to semantically equivalent CUDA including inherently data-parallel operators
      \item Utilization of device memory
    \end{itemize}
  \item We had fun!
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Future work}
  %
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Investigate optimizations wrt. the \textbf{usage} of
    the interest rate tree:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item alphas as input to program -- tradeoff between
        run-time computations and memory accesses (load). (Data spec.)
      \item inline alphas in program and loop-unroll --
        space-time tradeoff. (Partial evaluation.)
      \item other ideas?
    \end{itemize}
    %
  \item Investigate optimizations wrt. the
    \textbf{computation} of the interest rate tree
    %
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Model two term structures simultaneously.
    \end{itemize}
    %
  \item Define scheme for use in practice -- compute rates
    once, but similar derivatives many times.
  \end{itemize}
