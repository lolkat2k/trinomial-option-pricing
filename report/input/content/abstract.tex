\begin{abstract}
  In this report we describe the process of translating an
  option pricing program written in Futhark to CUDA. Our
  main focus is on flattening but we also consider memory
  optimisation strategies.

  Unfortunately, the code does not validate but we give
  pointers for how we would proceed in order to get the
  program running, along with proposals for future
  optimisations.
